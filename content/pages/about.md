Summary: About me.


Welcome to my website. My name is Tyler Russell, and I study mathematics at the University of Texas at Tyler. When I am not studying, I love programming, reading, running, and getting involved in local politics. I plan on pursuing graduate studies and hope to research dynamical systems and ergodic theory.
